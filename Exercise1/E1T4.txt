Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

1 IAM Role (InstanceRole) has full access to any s3 bucket instance. Again, violation of the
least privilege principle. Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions
performed upon them.

2. The WebAppSG is open to allow multiple port access from internet to WebSevice instance resides in public subnet. 
Instead Web Service should reside in Private subnet, This should sit in a private subnet and use port 443 instead of 80.
